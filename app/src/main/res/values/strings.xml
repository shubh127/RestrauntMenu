    <string name="coffee_description">Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While
        the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic
        steps; raw coffee beans must be roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be ground, the ground coffee must
        then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from
        the used grounds.

    <string name="espresso_description">Espresso’s authentic formula is clear and basic, its proper execution a matter
        of training, experience and natural talent. A jet of hot water at 88°-93°C (190°-200°F) passes under a pressure
        of nine or more atmospheres through a seven-gram (.25 oz) cake-like layer of ground and tamped coffee. Done
        right, the result is a concentrate of not more than 30 ml (one oz) of pure sensorial pleasure.

    <string name="french_fries_description">Heat a few inches of vegetable oil to 300 degrees F in a heavy pot. In 3 or
        4 batches, fry the potatoes about 4 to 5 minutes per batch, or until soft. They should not be brown at all at
        this point-you just want to start the cooking process. Remove each batch and drain them on new, dry paper
        towels.

    <string name="honey_description">
        While it is less likely that anyone would do this on their own if they are not a beekeeper, this might be useful
        for those who aspire to become one.Bees are really great and easy to keep, even in the urban environment! As
        Novella Carpenter calls them, bees are &quot;gateway animal for urban farmers&quot;. All you need is some space
        in the backyard/deck. The process of honey harvesting and extraction most likely happens on a separate days.
        These are the tools required.

    <string name="sugar_cubes_description">Sugar cubes are extremely simple to make at home - all you need is sugar and
        water. In addition to standard cubes, you can add color and flavor to add fun flair to a tea party or another
        gathering. Learn how to make sugar cubes using two different methods: using a pan in the oven or an ice cube
        tray you leave out overnight.
